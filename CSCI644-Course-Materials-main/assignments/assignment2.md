# Assignment 2

## Goals

* Use Ansible
* Update gcloud Dockerfile to have Ansible
* Deploy [Simple Microservice Example](https://github.com/CSUChico-CSCI644/simple-microservice-example) to GCP via Ansible and Ansible gcloud support
* Submit Ansible Playbook(s) to accomplish this.

## Deployment Requirements

Your playbook should create the GCP instance and deploy the application to it.
The application code already includes health checks, readiness checks, runtime
configuration, seed data, and end-to-end contract tests. Your work is to deploy
and configure those pieces correctly.

Your Ansible deployment must:

* Configure required service environment variables without hard-coding hostnames
  or secrets in the application source.
* Run the MongoDB seed script in a way that is safe to repeat.
* Configure NGINX so the frontend and `/api/` routes are reachable from one base
  URL. A domain name is not required.
* Start MongoDB, Redis, QuoteService, API Gateway, and NGINX using repeatable
  Ansible tasks.
* Run the contract test suite as the final verification step of the playbook.
  The playbook should fail if the contract tests fail.

The deployment is considered working when the Ansible playbook finishes by
running the contract tests from the target VM:

```bash
make test-e2e BASE_URL=http://localhost
```

## Video Recording

In addition to submitting your code to the course repo, submit a short screen
recording to Canvas. Do not commit the video file to Git.

In the recording, walk through your submission and explain what each major part
does. Show your Ansible playbooks, templates, inventory or variable files, and
the final verification step that runs the contract test suite.

The goal is not video production quality. The goal is to show that you
understand the work you submitted and can explain the choices in your own words.

## Submission

If you don't have a CSCI644 Git repo, go to Canvas to see the instructions for generating a Git Repo for this class.

You will submit many of the the assignments for this class to separate branches on your CSCI644 repo. Make sure you make an initial **main** branch first as this will make things easier.

Now submit your ansible playbook(s) and updated Dockerfile to the **assignment2** branch:

```bash
git checkout -b assignment2  #create branch and switch to it
git add -A  #add all
git commit -m "Assignment 2 Submission"  #Commit changes to branch
git push origin assignment2  #Push code up to assignment2 branch on remote
```

Make sure your branch is exactly named `assignment2` matching the case, spacing, etc as my grading script will only pull your submission if it matches exactly.

If you plan on making multiple updates to the code on this branch, you can include the `--set-upstream` option when you push the code (i.e. `git push --set-upstream origin assignment2`) -- this adds an upstream (tracking) reference so that, any time you push or pull from this branch in the future, you can simply use `git push` or `git pull`, without specifying the remote and branch.

If you would like to merge your `assignment2` branch with your `main` branch, you can run the following commands:
```bash
git checkout main  #switch to the main branch
git merge assignment2  #join the development history from the assignment1 branch with the current (main) branch
git push origin main  #push the assignment2 history up to the main branch on the remote
```
