# Assignment 4

## Goals

* Build on containerization of [Simple Microservice Example](https://github.com/CSUChico-CSCI644/simple-microservice-example) from assignment 3.
* Deploy [Simple Microservice Example](https://github.com/CSUChico-CSCI644/simple-microservice-example) as a Kubernetes deployment.
  * You should not publish any containers to container registries, everything should be built locally. Use of existing published official containers is allowed.
* Build a run script to spin up everything on a fresh cluster.

## Deployment Requirements

Run Kubernetes locally with Minikube. The application code already includes
health checks, readiness checks, runtime configuration, seed data, and
end-to-end contract tests. Your work is to express the deployment correctly in
Kubernetes.

Your Kubernetes deployment must:

* Include Deployments and Services for the frontend/NGINX, API Gateway,
  QuoteService, MongoDB, and Redis.
* Configure non-secret values with ConfigMaps and secret values with Secrets.
* Add liveness and readiness probes that use the provided `/healthz` and
  `/readyz` endpoints.
* Run the MongoDB seed script using a repeatable Job or initContainer approach.
* Use appropriate local storage for MongoDB data.
* Expose the application from Minikube to the host at `http://localhost:8080`
  using `kubectl port-forward`, a NodePort, or `minikube service`.

The deployment is considered working when this passes from the host machine:

```bash
make test-e2e BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080
```

## Local Verification Script

Include an executable script named `run-local-k8s.sh` in the root of your repo.
This script is for local grading and repeatable verification. It must:

* Create or start a dedicated Minikube profile for this assignment.
* Build or load the application images needed by your Kubernetes manifests.
* Deploy your Kubernetes manifests.
* Wait for the deployments to become ready.
* Expose the application to the host at `http://localhost:8080`.
* Run:

```bash
make test-e2e BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080
```

* Clean up by deleting the Minikube profile, even if the verification fails.

The script may call helper scripts, but a grader should be able to run
`./run-local-k8s.sh` from the repo root without manually editing IP addresses or
opening a separate terminal for port forwarding.

## Video Recording

In addition to submitting your code to the course repo, submit a short screen
recording to Canvas. Do not commit the video file to Git.

In the recording, walk through your submission and explain what each major part
does. Show your Kubernetes manifests, ConfigMaps, Secrets, probes, storage,
MongoDB seed approach, service exposure, and `run-local-k8s.sh` script.

The goal is not video production quality. The goal is to show that you
understand the work you submitted and can explain the choices in your own words.

## Submission

You should submit **all** files needed to build and deploy. You should also submit a run script that will start your minikube cluster, build, and deploy all from the single script.

### Submitting

If you don't have a CSCI644 Git repo, go to Canvas to see the instructions for generating a Git Repo for this class.

You will submit many of the the assignments for this class to separate branches on your CSCI644 repo. Make sure you make an initial **main** branch first as this will make things easier.

Now submit your all necessary files including your kubernetes *yaml* deployment file(s) and `run-local-k8s.sh` to the **assignment4** branch:

```bash
git checkout -b assignment4  #create branch and switch to it
git add -A  #add all
git commit -m "Assignment 4 Submission"  #Commit changes to branch
git push origin assignment4  #Push code up to assignment4 branch on remote
```

Make sure your branch is exactly named `assignment4` matching the case, spacing, etc as my grading script will only pull your submission if it matches exactly.

If you plan on making multiple updates to the code on this branch, you can include the `--set-upstream` option when you push the code (i.e. `git push --set-upstream origin assignment4`) -- this adds an upstream (tracking) reference so that, any time you push or pull from this branch in the future, you can simply use `git push` or `git pull`, without specifying the remote and branch.

If you would like to merge your `assignment4` branch with your `main` branch, you can run the following commands:
```bash
git checkout main  #switch to the main branch
git merge assignment4  #join the development history from the assignment1 branch with the current (main) branch
git push origin main  #push the assignment4 history up to the main branch on the remote
```
